		<b>Founded in 2015, Badgerloop is a student organization at the University of Wisconsin at Madison striving to make the fifth mode of transportation a reality. We provide members with the unique opportunity to work on real world engineering and business challenges during their college years. Our members come from a variety of majors who range from freshmen to PhD students. We compete with teams from around the world in the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition held in Hawthorne, CA.</b><br>

		<b>At Design Weekend in 2016, we took third place out of 120 teams. In January, we competed at Competition I and took home one of two Innovation Awards. We are currently creating an light and fast pod to compete in Competition II in hopes to establish Badgerloop as a leader in the development of Hyperloop technology!</b>
