## Local Development

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/). Make a new folder for the project, open `git bash` and navigate to this folder. Install [node.js v6.](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Run `git init` followed by `git remote add origin https://github.com/vkottler/badgerloopSoftware.git` followed by `git pull origin master`.

Run `npm install` while in the same folder. Now, you can run `node server website` or `node server dashboard` to serve local web traffic for either of these pages with a simple [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) server.
